    "abstract": "For over two decades, the National Library of Medicine (NLM)\r\nhas provided support for the collection of biomedical image data for use\r\nthroughout the biomedical image, visualization and analysis community.\r\nData collected during the Visible Human Project has been utilized to\r\nadvance development of medical image research, education, and other\r\nventures. One goal of our research has been to further diversify such\r\nimage data and make it openly available to the biomedical imaging community.\r\nThe approach is to provide open access to a diverse collection\r\nof biomedical image data that can be used for the development and validation\r\nof new image processing and analysis techniques. With support\r\nfrom NLM, over 100 datasets were incorporated into the NLM-Mayo\r\ndata collection. There is variation in species, anatomy, pathology, scale,\r\nand modality. In addition to providing linical qualitymedical image\r\ndata, the collection also includes newly acquired datasets of several animals,\r\nincluding a whole mouse with both T and R data volumes.\r\nThis unique collection of data was categorized and organized into an intuitive\r\nweb-based browser which allows a user to rapidly access descriptive\r\ninformation as well as the actual data volumes. The data collection\r\nwill be made available by the NLM for distribution, vis-a-vis its Visible\r\nHuman Project (VHP). Because the landscape of biomedical imaging\r\ncontinues to change with new, advanced image acquisition systems and\r\ntechniques, continuously updating the VHP data collection seems prudent.\r\nAdditional new and varied image data will be incorporated into our\r\ncollection and disseminated to researchers in the medical image analysis\r\ncommunity.",
