    "abstract": "When an image is mostly composed of background pixels, most of the automatic\r\nthresholding methods are failing to produce a relevant threshold. This is mainly\r\ncaused because one mode is over represented compared to the other in the histogram\r\nof the image. The Kappa-Sigma clipping, a method largely used in astronomy, don't\r\ntry to separate 2 modes in the histogram, but rather try to find the properties of\r\nthe only usable mode, the one of the background, and compute a threshold to select\r\nthe values significantly different of the background.",
