    "abstract": "ManagedITK generates wrappers around ITK for .NET languages. These wrappers can be used with any CLR language, including C#, VB.NET, IronPython, and others. ManagedITK is useful for a number of reasons, including the ability to rapidly create graphical user interfaces using Windows Forms (also known as System.Windows.Forms). Full source code and many in-depth examples accompany this article. Pre-compiled .NET assemblies can also be downloaded for easy integration into standalone C# applications.",
