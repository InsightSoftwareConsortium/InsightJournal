    "abstract": "It is sometimes useful to be able to apply binary morphological operations, such as erosions and dilations, to labelled images in a fashion that preserves the labels. This article introduces a specialised class implementing parallel methods described in beare et al [2011] that provide very fast dilations by circles and spheres of arbitary size. Comparisons with other implementations using currently available building blocks are also made.\n",
