    "introductory_text": "The goal of this challenge is to compare fully automatic methods for segmenting anatomical structures in head and neck CT data used in radiotherapy planning. One bony structure -mandible- and one soft tissue structure -brainstem- are offered for the competition. They both represent important organs at risk, which need to be accurately delineated in preparation for radiation treatment.",
