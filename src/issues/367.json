    "introductory_text": "Open interfaces/frameworks increase the pace of research and discovery by promoting collaborations within and between clinicians, biomedical engineers, and software developers. These systems usually modular architectures to model the complexity involved in surgical assistance systems. Hence, standards are critical to allow for cross-framework interoperability of systems, and modules.",

    "short_description": "The goal of this workshop is to establish a forum for discussing systems and architectures for computer assisted intervention (CAI) applications. Continuing the success of the last three years, the workshop will focus on open interfaces, interoperability, and standards. In addition, this year, we will discuss practical issues, clinical applications and future directions of CAI systems and frameworks. As in the previous years, this workshop will include strong participation from industry and academia."
