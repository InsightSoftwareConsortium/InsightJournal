This workshop was offered for six consecutive years at\nMICCAI 2008-2013 and focused on open interfaces, interoperability, and standards.\n\nWe propose to reinstitute this successful workshop series for MICCAI 2016, with renewed focus on these topics and highlighting recent developments in open source, shared research platforms."
