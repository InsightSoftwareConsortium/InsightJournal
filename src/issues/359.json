    "introductory_text": "Imaging plays an important role in the management of tumors, including lesion detection, quantification and classification, decision-making for treatment planning, and assessment of response to treatment. Mass information is visually presented in images while crucial information for clinical decision-making is expressed by types of imaging biomarkers, which reflect key aspects of the presence and progression of tumors. Validation and standardization of relevant biomarkers is required to 1) guide clinical management for individual patients and 2) coordinate large-scale clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents among multiple centers. For researchers, it is important to not only find the proper association between imaging biomarkers and clinical endpoints, but also extract and quantify imaging biomarkers in an objective, efficient and reliable way. The 1-day workshop aims to report the latest progress and development on computational methods, tools and procedures for the extraction and quantification of imaging biomarkers, with the specific application in tumor management.\n",
