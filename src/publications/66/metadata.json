  "abstract": "To facilitate the analysis of medical image data in research environment, MATITK is developed to allow ITK algorithms to be called in MATLAB. ITK is a powerful open-source image analysis toolkit, but it requires the knowledge of C++ to use it. With the help of MATITK, researchers familiar with MATLAB can harness the power of ITK without learning C++ and worrying about low-level programming issues. A common set of C++ classes have also been produced to allow future ITK methods to be added to MATITK therefore callable in MATLAB without the bothersome translation between MATLAB and ITK.",
