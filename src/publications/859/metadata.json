  "abstract": "Skull-stripping (or brain extraction) is an important pre-processing step in neuroimage analysis. This document describes a skull-stripping filter implemented using the Insight Toolkit ITK, which we named itk::StripTsImageFilter. It is a composite filter based on existing ITK classes. The filter has been implemented with usability, robustness, speed and versatility in mind, rather than accuracy. This makes it useful for many pre-processing tasks in neuroimage analysis. This paper is accompanied by the source code, input data and a testing environment.",
