  "abstract": "This paper introduces an integrated 3D medical image\r\nprocessing and analyzing software platform which is open interface\r\nand freely available. The platform consists of the Medical Imaging\r\nToolkit (MITK) and the 3-Dimensional Medical Image Processing and\r\nAnalyzing System (3DMed). MITK is an algorithm toolkit for research\r\nand software development, while 3DMed is a MITK based application\r\nsystem with a plug-in framework. The overall architecture and main\r\ncapabilities of the platform are described in detail. Presented\r\nevaluations demonstrate that the platform can benefit the\r\ndevelopment of computer assisted intervention systems.",
