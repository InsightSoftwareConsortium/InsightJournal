  "abstract": "The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) project aims to create a\r\ncellular-resolution, genome-wide map of gene expression in the adult\r\nmouse brain. The resulting in situ hybridization (ISH) image data\r\nwill be available free-of-charge to the public. Additionally, we are\r\ndeveloping an informatics pipeline to support searching of the data by\r\nanatomic region and expression level and/or pattern. This paper\r\ndescribes a robust, high-throughput registration scheme to\r\nautomatically annotate hierarchical brain structures in the ISH\r\nimagery.",
