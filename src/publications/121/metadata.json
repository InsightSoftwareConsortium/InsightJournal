    "abstract": "We consider 2-D and 3-D digital binary images characterized by their well-composedness. Well-composed images exhibit important topological and geometrical properties not shared by their ill-composed counterparts. \r\nThese properties have important implications for various algorithms used by the ITK community such as thinning algorithms and Marching Cubes. We introduce two image filters which repair images that are ill-composed such that the output images are well-composed.",
