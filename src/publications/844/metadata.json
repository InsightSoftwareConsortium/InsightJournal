    "abstract": "This document presents a new class to apply an itkImageFunction to every pixel in an itkImage. This functionality is almost identical to itkUnaryFunctorImageFilter, but it uses an itkImageFunction rather than an itk::Functor. As some functionalities in ITK seem to have been implemented as image functors (itk::Functor::AND, itk::Functor::Atan, etc.) while other seems to have been implemented as itkImageFunction's (itk::BinaryThresholdImageFunction, itk::CentralDifferenceImageFunction, etc.), it seems reasonable to be able to apply any of these operations to an entire image.\n\nThe code is available here: http://review.source.kitware.com/#change,2008",
