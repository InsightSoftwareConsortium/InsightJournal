  "abstract": "This document presents a system to \"scribble\" on an image to mark foreground and background pixels and then feed these pixels to a graph cuts segmentation technique. The interaction is done using the Visualization Toolkit and the processing is done using the Insight Toolkit. The graph cut function itself is the maxflow-v2.21 algorithm written by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov. This version of their algorithm is released under a GPL license. \n\nThe code for this paper can be found here: \nhttps://github.com/daviddoria/InteractiveImageGraphCutSegmentation/commit/259cd239169c5ea8c44cc68908886eca10cc8239\n\nUpdates will be published here: https://github.com/daviddoria/InteractiveImageGraphCutSegmentation\n\nNote: You must use the latest git version of VTK as of the date of this publication to avoid compiler errors due to newly added functions.",
