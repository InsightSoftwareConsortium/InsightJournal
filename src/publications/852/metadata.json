    "abstract": "Unlike the measure of the area in 2D or of the volume in 3D, the perimeter and the surface are not easily measurable in a discretized image.\nIn this article we describe a method based on the Crofton formula to measure those two parameters in a discritized image. The accuracy of the method is discussed and tested on several known objects. An algorithm based on the run-length encoding of binary objects is presented and compared to other approaches.\nAn implementation is provided and integrated in the LabelObject/LabelMap framework contributed earlier by the authors.",
