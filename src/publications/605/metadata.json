  "abstract": "This paper presents a new fully automatic method for segmentation of\r\nbrain images that possess multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions.\r\nMultichannel magnetic resonance images are used to delineate multiple\r\nsclerosis lesions while segmenting the brain into its major\r\nstructures. The method is an atlas based segmentation\r\ntechnique employing a topological atlas as well as a statistical\r\natlas. An advantage of this approach is that all segmented structures\r\nare topologically constrained, thereby allowing subsequent processing\r\nwith cortical unfolding or diffeomorphic shape analysis techniques.\r\nValidation on data from two studies demonstrates that the method has\r\nan accuracy comparable with other MS lesion segmentation methods,\r\nwhile simultaneously segmenting the whole brain.",

    "content": "<p>This methods extends the existing frameworks for topologically constrained tissue segmentation by Bazin to incorporate an MS lesion model. WM and lesions are grouped together for the topological constraint. Within this joint MS+WM region, each voxel is then classified either as WM or MS based on the computed tissue classification model (unlike WM, lesions have no prior weight in the classification).</p><p>The method is quite appealing with good results. Good discussion.</p><p>The paper is overall well written and no major revisions are needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
