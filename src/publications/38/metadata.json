  "abstract": "Using the path framework we previously added to ITK, we implemented a novel algorithm for n-dimensional path optimization, which we call the ND Swath (NDS). NDS uses dynamic programming to globally optimize the placement of a path within an image, subject to several constraints and a user-supplied merit function. The NDS algorithm is presented in this paper along with a description of how it was implemented using ITK.",

    "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThe paper presents a novel N-dimensional path optimization algorithm called NDS.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThat the new NDS algorithm can find optimal path given reasonably close initial paths.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nA description of the algorithm, a description of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implementation, complexity analysis and a single 2D example. No higher dimensional examples were provided.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nNo source code, nor executables, nor input/output data are available.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe paper does not facilitate reproducing the work described within. Adding the described work as extensions to ITK as was done with the underlying path classes would make reproduction easy.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe work is based on and extends ITK. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nNo code was provided.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nNo code was provided.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nThe method would apply to may problems.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe method seems to be very similar to the Dijkstra method for optimal shortest paths. Please add a comparison to that algorithm to the paper. Especially for open paths from source to sink you may find equivalence in the optimal path. I used Dijkstra and a special merit function to find optimal chain-code path centerlines and skeletons in a 2001 TVCG paper called \u00e2\u0080\u009cPenalized-Distance Volumetric Skeleton Algorithm\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\r\nIt is not clear what you mean when you talk about \u00e2\u0080\u009cscale space\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Please add a reference.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nPlease provide more examples, including higher dimensional ones, as you claim the method does work in N dimensions.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nI assume that by design this only works for chain-code paths, not for parametric paths. In case it can work for both, please clarify in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b> Conclusions:</b>\r\nThis paper does not adhere to open science standards, and is lacking some evidence that it will work on a variety of inputs of different dimensionality. It also could improve its background analysis. Once those things are ironed out it will be applicable to a wide range of problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper presents an algorithm for optimizing a path through pixels in an image. The algorithm is based on dynamic programing and accepts a user-provided optimization criterion. The paper provides a nice description of the mathematical principles behind the optimization approach, and a brief description of how those principles are implemented in an open source software.\r\n \r\n<b>Hypothesis:</b>\r\nThe paper presents the hypothesis that dynamic programming methods are suitable for optimizing paths on digital images.\r\n\r\n<b>Evidence:</b>\r\nThe paper does not provide evidence for the hypothesis. \r\n\r\n<b>Open Science:</b>\r\nThe paper does not satisfy the criteria of open science since no material is provided that will allow the readers to verify the claims in the paper.\r\n\r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nThe paper did not provided enough elements for enabling reproducibility. The paper is too focused on the mathematical description of the algorithm and not enough on its implementation and usability.\r\n\r\n<b>Use of Open Source Software:</b>\r\nThe authors used the Insight Toolkit as development platform.\r\n\r\n<b>Open Source Contributions:</b>\r\nThe authors mention that their code was implemented in the form of ITK classes, but do not indicate where the reader can find these classes, or whether they are available.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThere was no code available that would have allowed the reviewer to verify the quality.\r\n\r\n<b>Applicability to other problems:</b>\r\nAn algorithm for path optimization will have a wide range of applications. In particular on segmentation of anatomical structures.\r\n\r\n<b>Suggestions for future work:</b>\r\nThe reviewer encourage the authors to provide more examples of the use of their code.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\nThe reviewer will appreciate if the authors address more details on how their classes where implemented and how they can be used by others in order to foster their research.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Comments:</b>\r\nIt is remarkable that the authors adopted the N-Dimensional philosophy of the Insight Toolkit. Implementing N-D algorithms require a significant amount of effort, but also provides a significant amount of return, since the algorithm can be applied to a larger set of problems.\r\n",
