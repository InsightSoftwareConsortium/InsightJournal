  "abstract": "Using the path framework we previously added to ITK, we implemented a novel algorithm for n-dimensional path optimization, which we call the ND Swath (NDS). NDS uses dynamic programming to globally optimize the placement of a path within an image, subject to several constraints and a user-supplied merit function. The NDS algorithm is presented in this paper along with a description of how it was implemented using ITK.",
