  "abstract": "Three-dimensional laser scanner is a modern technology used to detect and capture the shape of complex objects. There are a lot of possible application fields for this technology: applications in the industrial sector (reverse engineering), in the medical field or in the cultural heritage field for virtual reconstruction of works of art. \nThe main goal of this work is to make accessible the three-dimensional models obtained from laser scans on mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), exploiting a remote rendering application on high-performance workstations.\nThis paper also shows how this can be done fairly easily using one of the most popular instruments in the field of scientific visualization, VTK.",
