    "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to higher dimensional segmentation. We present an extended Active Shape Model (ASM) formulation for the segmentation of multi-contour anatomical structures. We employ coupling and weighting schemes to improve the robustness of ASM segmentation. 3D segmentation is achieved through propagation of a 2D ASM using a learned non-rigid spatial model. This approach does not su\ufb00er from the training and aligning di\ufb03culties faced by direct 3D model-based methods. Experimental results are encouraging at this early stage, and future directions of research are provided. \n",
