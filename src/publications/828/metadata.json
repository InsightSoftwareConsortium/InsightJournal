  "abstract": "This document presents an implementation of an algorithm to perform a morphological opening on a graph. The intent is to remove short branches in a graph while preserving the large scale structure. This implementation is based on the algorithm described in ``Efficient Closed Contour Extraction from Range Image's Edge Points''. We have used the data structures from Boost Graph Library (BGL).\n\nThe code is available here:\nhttps://github.com/daviddoria/GraphOpening",
