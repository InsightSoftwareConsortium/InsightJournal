  "abstract": "Nonlinear optimization is a key component of many image registration algorithms. Improving registration speed is almost always desirable. One way to do this is to accelerate the optimization cost function using a parallel implementation. The purpose of this document is to provide a tutorial on how to combine the CUDA GPU computing framework with standard nonlinear optimization libraries (VNL) using CMake. The provided code can be used as a starting template for programmers looking for a relatively painless introduction to CUDA-accelerated medical image registration and other nonlinear optimization problems.",
