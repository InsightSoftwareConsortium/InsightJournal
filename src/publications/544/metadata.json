  "abstract": "The goal of this workshop is to establish a forum for discussing open source toolkits and open\r\ninterfaces and how they have been applied in the development of computer assisted intervention\r\nsystems. The intent is to establish a dialogue between the open source community, industry, and\r\nresearchers in the field. The workshop will include presentations and panel discussions about: 1)\r\nexisting open source toolkits, 2) open (research) interfaces to medical products, and 3) integrated\r\nsystems for computer assisted interventions.",
