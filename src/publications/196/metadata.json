  "abstract": "This document describes the process used in implementing image segmentation through a region growing algorithm with the use of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) imaging program. The code used to implement the region growing algorithm is documented in the ITK Software Guide and makes use of the ITK library. This paper is accompanied with all source code, input data, parameters and output data that were originally used in developing the image segmentation application, except where prior laws or agreements prohibit redistribution of such material. The only data subject to not being redistributable was the input file used for testing which was a brain dataset from Kitware\u2019s MIDAS collection named Normal090-T2.mha. The rest of this scientific publication is written in a manner such that it facilitates reproducibility of the reported results.",

    "content": "<strong>Summary:</strong><br />Julio Lajara clearly explains how to perform Image Segmentation: Ventricle Isolation using Region Growing with attached code that he wrote.&nbsp; He also includes a sample output .mha file to compare to the one the reader of this submission might create, using Julio&#39;s instructions.<br /> <br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br />Julio includes clear diagrams and explanations (with cited references).<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />Julio included his source code, and cleverly did not include the source .mha file which he does not have permission to redistribute.&nbsp; He did however include a derivative work, his .mha output which I was easily able to reproduce using the included instructions.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I was able to reproduce Julio&#39;s included .mha file perfectly, after downloading the publicly available source .mha file and following his instructions.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />Source code is included, it took me about 10 minutes to download the required .mha file, and reproduce Julio&#39;s results using his code and instructions - very easy to follow.<br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br /> Code is very readable, well commented.<br /> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br /> Julio analyzed a different Image Segmentation method than I did, but it looks similar to the one I chose.&nbsp; I would imagine that Julio&#39;s process would apply well to other segmentation methods as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br /> The homework assignment looks 100% complete to me!<br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />Nice job!<br /> <br /> ",
