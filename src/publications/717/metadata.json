    "abstract": "The Fourier transform of the convolution of two images is equal to the product of their\nFourier transform. With this definition, it is possible to create a convolution filter\nbased on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The interesting complexity characteristics of\nthis transform gives a very efficient convolution filter for large kernel images.\n\nThis paper provides such a filter, as well as a detailed description of the implementation\nchoices and a performance comparison with the \"simple\" itk::ConvolutionImageFilter.\n",
