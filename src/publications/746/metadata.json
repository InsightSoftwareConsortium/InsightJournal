  "abstract": "This document describes a project that can compare many images simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Such an application can be used in any ITK/VTK image processing pipelines; the programmer can use it to quickly visualize and compare intermediate results of used filters within the pipeline.The goals of this project are two folds: (i) to be integrated in gdb pretty debuggers (for visual debugging of ITK pipelines), and, (ii) to provide a visual comparison widget for image-to-image plugins (ITK or VTK based filters).\nThis project is part of the Gofigure2 development effort, an open-source, cross-platform application for visualizing, processing and analyzing of multidimensional microscopy data.
