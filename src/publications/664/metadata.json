  "abstract": "Simbionix\u00ae Ltd, world-leader in surgical simulation, just pioneered the commercial use of patient-specific simulation: a tool for rehearsing an operation prior to performing it. Carotid stenting was chosen as the first release of a patient-specific simulated operation. Simbionix partnered with Shina Systems\u00ae in making the Segmentation module. The resulting tool is presented and discussed herein.",
