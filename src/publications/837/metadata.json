  "abstract": "A recent article by Van Hecke et al. [3] describes a framework for creating simulated diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The methodology allows for modeling intersubject variability, regional pathology, and noise and is quite useful for evaluation purposes. This article describes our ITK implementation of this work which we provide to the community as open source.",
