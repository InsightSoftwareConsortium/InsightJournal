  "abstract": "This papers describes an image filter that counts the number of neighbors a pixel has storing that value at the pixel's image index. Functionality is provided to 1) adjust the neighborhood size, 2) count only those pixels within a specific value range, and 3) only record a neighbor count for specific pixels of interest. This paper is accompanied with source code for the filter and test, test images and parameters, and expected output images.",
