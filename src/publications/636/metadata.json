  "abstract": "We propose a new clustering algorithm. This algorithm performs clustering and manifold learning simultaneously by using a graph-theoretical approach to manifold learning. We apply this algorithm in order to cluster white matter \ufb01ber tracts obtained fromDiffusion TensorMRI (DT-MRI) through streamline tractography. Our algorithm is able perform clustering of these fiber tracts incorporating information about the shape of the \ufb01ber and a priori knowledge as the probability of the fiber belonging to known anatomical structures. This anatomical knowledge is incorporated as a volumetric white matter atlas, in this case LONI's ICBM DTI-81",
