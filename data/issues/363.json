    "introductory_text": "The Computational Algorithms Journal is an Open Access on-line publication covering the domain of computational algorithms. This journal is intended to be a place to share algorithm implementations with a very low barrier of entry. The goal of this journal is to fill in some of the gaps left by research which is published in a non-reproducible way. Potential things to submit to this journal are:\n - Algorithm implementations\n - Accessible descriptions and explanations of algorithms",

This continuous issue promotes new algorithms not necessarily related to specific toolkits such as ITK and VTK.\n\nIf your submission proposes and extension or addition to ITK or VTK, please submit to the corresponding issues instead.
