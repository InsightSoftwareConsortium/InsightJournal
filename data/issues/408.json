    "introductory_text": "The primary objective of this MICCAI 2015 challenge is to establish an unbiased benchmark of automatic segmentation performance. It is hoped that this challenge will give valuable feedback both to researchers and the user community about algorithm performance in real world applications. In addition the challenge will provide medical imaging researchers a venue where they can discuss and form collaborations on medical image segmentation for radiotherapy planning.<br>\n<br>\nThe organizing committee is:<br>\n- Karl Fritscher, UMIT<br>\n- Patrik Raudaschl, UMIT<br>\n- Greg Sharp, MGH<br>\n- Paolo Zaffino, UMG<br>",
