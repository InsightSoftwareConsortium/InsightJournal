The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for sharing developments in systems and architectures for computer assisted intervention (CAI) applications. Continuing the success of the last five years, the workshop will focus on open interfaces, interoperability, and standards. This sixth edition will include a broader forum for poster/interactive demonstrations, and expert panel insights into practical issues, clinical applications and future directions of CAI systems and frameworks. As in its previous iterations, the workshop will continue the tradition of strong participation from both industry and academia.",
