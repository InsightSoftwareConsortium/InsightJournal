    "introductory_text": "The goal of this workshop is to establish a forum for discussing open interfaces, interoperability, and standards for the development of computer assisted intervention systems.<br>\nModularization of surgical assist systems is of growing importance due to the increasing complexity of the components such a system consists of. Forthcoming systems will have to depend on reliable components and frameworks, which are used as building blocks to realize the desired functionality. Standards are the key to modularization since they allow for cross-vendor interoperability of systems and modules.",
