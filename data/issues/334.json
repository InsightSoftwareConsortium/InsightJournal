    "introductory_text": "The goal of this workshop is to establish a forum for discussing open source toolkits and open interfaces and how they have been applied in the development of computer assisted intervention systems. The intent is to establish a dialogue between the open source community, industry, and researchers in the field. The workshop will include presentations and panel discussions about: 1) existing open source toolkits, 2) open (research) interfaces to medical products, and 3) integrated systems for computer assisted interventions.",
