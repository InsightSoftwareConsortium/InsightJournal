    "abstract": "We present a framework for statistical finite element analysis allowing performing statistical statements of biomechanical performance of peri-articular implants across a given population. In this paper, we focus on the design of orthopaedic implants that fit a maximum percentage of the target population, both in terms of geometry and biomechanical stability. CT scans of the bone under consideration are registered non-rigidly to obtain correspondences in position between them. A statistical model of shape is computed by means of principal component analysis. A method to automatically propagate standardize fractures on the statistically-based bone population has been developed as well as tools to optimize implant position to best-fit the bone surface. Afterwards, finite element analysis is performed to analyse the biomechanical performance of the bone/implant construct. The mechanical behaviour of different PCA bone instances is compared for tibia representing the Asian and Caucasian populations.",

        "content": "<p><em>(This review can be also viewed by opening the attached PDF file)</em></p><p>The paper addresses an important problem of the design of orthopaedic implants to to<br />ensure that they fit the maximum of the target population. The Authors build statistical<br />shape model of a tibia and use to optimise the implant position. They also conduct<br />modelling analysis (FE method is used) biomechanical performance of bone-implant<br />construct. The methodology appears to be original and technically sound. However, some<br />aspects (bone-to-bone and bone-to-implant interactions) of the modelling conduct require<br />further clarification. Therefore, my opinion is that before the paper can be regarded as<br />ready for publication/presentation in the Workshop, the Authors should answer the<br />questions given below and modify the paper following them.</p><p><br /><strong>Major comments</strong><br />1) Biomechanical FE Simulations: How were the interactions between two split (as a<br />result of fracture) bone parts and between the bones and implant modelled?<br />The Authors write that &ldquo;3D beam elements were used to fix implant to the bone&rdquo;<br />and that &ldquo;Attachment of the beam to the bone was preformed using an embedded<br />element technique&rdquo;. However, in order for such modelling of attachment to be<br />meaningful, the implant should be allowed to move/slide in relation to the bone. This<br />would require application of contact interface (or similar type of constrain) between<br />the implant and bone, and between two split bone parts. The paper does not mention<br />existence of any type of such interface between the bone and implant and between<br />two split bone parts.</p><p><br />2) What finite element solver was used and what type of finite element analysis (i.e.<br />geometrically linear or non-linear) was applied?</p><p><br />3) Legend of Table 1 (p. 8): Was the bone-implant distance determined using imagebased<br />methods described in Sections 2-4?</p><p><br /><strong>Minor comments</strong><br />1) P. 2 reference [Rueckert] is missing in the Reference list</p><p><br />2) P. 2, figure 1 caption. Is: &ldquo;axis&rdquo;, should be: &ldquo;axes&rdquo; (plural)</p><p><br />3) P. 3, second column, second paragraph. Is: &ldquo;the fracture should be a continuous&rdquo;,<br />should be: &ldquo;the fracture should be continuous&rdquo;</p><p><br />4) P. 4, last sentence. Is &ldquo;in Eq. 3&rdquo;, should be: &ldquo;in Eq. 4&rdquo;. </p>",
