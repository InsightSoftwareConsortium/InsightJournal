    "abstract": "An implementation of the minimum error thresholding algorithm is presented. In this implementation, two versions of the minimum error thresholding algorithm are made available, one utilizing a Gaussian- and the other utilizing a Poisson- mixture model. Two ITK classes are created: The first one (MinErrorThresholdImageCalculator) is used to compute the threshold; the second (MinErrorThresholdImageFilter) is used as an image-thresholding filter. The results indicate code correctness and are comparable to those of Otsu\u2019s thresholding algorithm.",
