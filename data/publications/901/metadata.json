    "abstract": "This paper describes an automated algorithm for segmentation\nof brain structures (CSF, white matter, and gray matter) in MR\nimages. We employ machine learning, i.e. k-Nearest Neighbors, of features\nderived from k-means, Canny edge detection, and Tourist Walks\nto fully automate the seeding process of the Random Walker algorithm.\nWe test our methods on a dataset of 12 diabetes patients with atrophy\nand varying degrees of white matter lesions provided by the MRBrainS13\nChallenge, and \ffind encouraging segmentation performance.",
