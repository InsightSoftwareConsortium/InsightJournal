    "abstract": "This article provides an implementation of our non-parametric diffeomorphic image registration algorithm generalizing Thirion's demons algorithm. Within the Insight Toolkit (ITK), the demons algorithm is implemented as part of the finite difference solver framework. We show that this framework can be extended to handle diffeomorphic transformations. The source code is composed of a set of reusable ITK filters and classes. In addition to an overview of our implementation, we provide a small example program that allows the user to compare the different variants of the demons algorithm.",

        "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />This submission provides an implementation of a diffeomorphic nonrigid demons registration algorithm. It comes with a stand-alone command line tool that provides many useful options and is fit for production use.<br /> </p><p><strong>Evidence:</strong><br />The authors provide test images.<br /> </p><p><strong>Open Science:</strong><br />Source code and test data are provided.<br /> </p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I have not tested the tool with the data provided by the authors. I have, however, run extensive tests on my own data in a longitudinal deformation-based morphometry study. I find the core algorithm to be very efficient and about as accurate as the original demons algorithm. I was also able to confirm that the produced transformations are essentially diffeomorphic. There occasionally&nbsp; appear to be small fractions of pixels with negative Jacobians, but this seems mostly connected to almost-folding input deformation fields that I sometimes provide to the algorithm.<br /><br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />Uses ITK.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />Source code is provided. Compiles successfully out of the box using current CVS version of ITK.</p><p> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />The code quality is excellent. The code appears to conform with ITK coding style and is virtually fully documented. The bundled command line tool provides options for different update rules, multi-resolution registration, initial deformation fields, and intensity histogram normalization.</p><p> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />n/a<br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />n/a<br /> <br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />n/a<br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />I would strongly advocate adding this contribution to ITK as soon as possible. The nonrigid registrations in the toolkit are a little outdated right now and could really use some newer algorithms. In particular diffeomorphic registration has become a hot topic recently, and it would be great to have a diffeomorphic registration algorithm available in ITK, in particular one that is as efficient as this one. I would also advocate including the command line tool that comes with the software in the ITK source tree. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
