    "abstract": "Although Gabor filtering is quite prevalent in the computer vision community for such tasks as \r\ntexture segmentation and motion analysis, such capabilities are conspicuously absent from the \r\nInsight Toolkit. The contribution described in this paper attempts to remedy this deficiency by \r\nintroducing two new classes: itkGaborKernelFunction and itkGaborImageSource.",
