    "abstract": "The Johns Hopkins University Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) modular software framework provides support for robotic devices, imaging sensors and a visualization pipeline for rapid prototyping, primarily for surgical research systems. We extend the SAW architecture for \"steady hand\" micromanipulation in biomanipulation laboratory tasks. The proposed system integrates direct \"steady-hand\" manipulation, teleoperation, and automated manipulation in a single two-handed system. System architecture, implementation and initial performance measurement experiments are detailed.",
