    "abstract": "This paper describes a new open-source tutorial for image-guided therapy (IGT) and medical robotics that is both accessible and hands-on using the LEGO Mindstorms NXT (a commercially available robotics kit) and 3D Slicer (an open-source application for medical image processing). The tutorial covers all stages of a typical IGT or medical robotics procedure, including the concepts of imaging, preoperative planning, targeting and tracking, navigation and registration, by using the LEGO robot to perform a \u201cneedle biopsy\u201d on a phantom (anatomical model) made of traditional LEGO pieces. In addition, this paper describes a C++ library that allows direct control of a LEGO Mindstorms NXT robot from a Linux computer over a USB connection.",

        "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />This paper very clearly presents tutorials for building a LEGO-based robot and phantom for teaching and exploring the basics of image-guided robotic control for needle biospies. Also included is software for a C++ interface to the robot.</p><p>This project builds upon the LEGO Mindstorm robot and the NXT++ library for controlling that robot. The tutorials and papers also refer to a 3D Slicer v3 module for IGT.</p><p>The paper also includes an excellent evaluation of the accuracy of the robot given repeated applications of the tutorial script. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong><br />The instructions for building the phantom is outstanding. I am confident that if I had the LEGO pieces, then I could build it.</p><p>The tutorials are extremely well written and illustrated. They seem to be viable for a wide range of ages and backgrounds. These tutorials exceed the standard for open-source teaching materials. Basic and advanced tutorials are presented.</p><p>The instructions for building the robot seem to be missing.</p><p>The instructions for accessing (i.e., the code for) the Slicer 3D module are missing. A Google search does not reveal the &quot;Lego Module&quot; for Slicer. As a result, the basic and advanced tutorials cannot be replicated. </p><p>The robot control software included with the tutorial is a modified version of the NXT++ library.<br />1) The authors have ported the NXT++ library to 64-bit linux systems which is important for IGT research/environments<br />2) The NXT++ library is GPL licensed and therefore the included code is GPL licensed, however those licensing terms are never given in the code.<br />3) The code claims to be copyrighted by the Insight Software Consortium - but it is not. A legitimate copyright needs to be declared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Results:</strong><br />Once the missing pieces are provided (LEGO-pun intended), this tutorial will be the highlight of many high-school, college, graduate, and perhaps even medical school courses. </p><p>As the authors point out, the focus of the tutorials is not robot building, but instead it is on IGT theory (planning, calibration, registration, and control). The concepts of error measurement presented in the paper are also excellent companionS to the how-to nature of the tutorials. When those topics are to be discussed in a classroom, the tutorials discussed provide a unique hands-on / real-world method for conveying the key concepts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p><p>The material provided sets a high standard for the presentation and evaluation of tutorial materials in a field (IGT) that desperately needs broadly useful educational materials. Furthermore, the use of LEGOs makes the tutorials cost effective and &quot;friendly&quot; to make IGT more accessible.</p><p>The absence of two key pieces (robot building instructions and the Slicer module) inhibit the actual use of the tutorial material, but hopefully the authors can quickly correct this oversight. </p>",

They present a low cost robotic system that is driven by the open source software Slicer. Although, at this moment, they don&#39;t provide the user guide to build the robot, and the CT dataset of the phantom, they explain how they use it and how to use it.<br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />This is an example of Open Science because they present a system that uses open source software and they describe a low cost robotic system, that could be bought for any research group. However is very important to add the guide to build the system and the CT dataset of the phantom<br /><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I would like to reproduce the results, but although I&#39;m going to buy the LEGO system, I need the user guide to build the robot. I could be great to have the CT dataset of the phantom too.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />They use open source software (Slicer) and they provide the software associated to the LEGO system. It could be great to provide the VTK Slicer module (at least at the svn slicer site) to reproduce the system.<br /><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />They provide some code, but it would be great to provide the VTK Slicer module.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />It is well commented.<br /><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />How we are using slicer for medical students education, we would like to use this system. At this moment, we need the VTK Slicer module and the CT dataset of the phantom.<br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />I&#39;ve read that authors are providing the user guide to build the robotic system. Also, we need the VTK Slicer module and perhaps the CT dataset. We would like to use it for education and teaching.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />Nice work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
