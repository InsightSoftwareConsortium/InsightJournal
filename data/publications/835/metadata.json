    "abstract": "This code provides an implementation of a simple technique to fill small holes in an image. We use a multi-pass method that fills pixels on the border of a hole with the average of its non-hole 8-connected neighbors. This process is repeated until all holes are filled.\n\nThe code is available here: https://github.com/daviddoria/SmallHoleFiller",
