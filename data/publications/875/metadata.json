    "abstract": "This document describes the workflow for unwarping echo planar MR images (EPI), in particular diffusion-weighted images, using an acquisition method with reversed phase encoding and the tools of the Computational Morphometry Toolkit (CMTK). This technique requires an additional acquisition (additional b=0 image for diffusion imaging) with reversed phase encoding direction, but no field map. Simple 6-direction diffusion data are provided with this article for demonstration.",
