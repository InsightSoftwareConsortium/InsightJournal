    "abstract": "A hierarchy of path data types and basic path filters were added to ITK, providing a general framework for curves that map a scalar value to a point in n-dimensional space. The framework supports curves that are either continuous (parametric curves) or discrete (chain-codes). Example usage of the entire framework is demonstrated using a previously published 2D active contour algorithm that was converted to ITK.",
