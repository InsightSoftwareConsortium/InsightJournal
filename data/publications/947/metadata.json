    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of primary\nbrain tumor, which is characterized by an infiltrative growth pattern.\nIn current practice, radiotherapy planning is primarily based upon T2\nFLAIR MRI despite its known lack of specificity in the detection of tu-\nmor infiltration. While hyperintensity on T2 FLAIR is widely considered\nto represent infiltrative tumor, it may also be caused by the presence\nof vasogenic edema (VE), caused by a leakage of fluid into the brain\nparenchyma. Distinguishing VE from infiltrative tumor could have im-\npact on improving radiotherapy planning. In this paper we study a data\nset of 17 GBM patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapy for which\na fast decrease of T2 FLAIR hypersignal is observed, which indicates\nthe resolution of VE. We investigate if multimodal MRI acquisitions in-\ncluding diffusion tensor imaging can distinguish between VE and tumor\ninfiltration prior to therapy. Using a random forest classifier, we show\nthat, in this study, morphological information based on the contrast en-\nhanced T1 image explains up to 75% of the extent of VE. The information\nfrom different imaging modalities did not significantly improve the clas-\nsification. We then show that delineating the VE prior to therapy can\nhave substantial impact on radiotherapy target delineation, leading to\nsmaller treatment volumes and reducing potentially harmful radiation\ndose to normal brain tissue.\n",
