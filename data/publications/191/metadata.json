    "abstract": "This document describes implementation of two Level-set segmentation algorithms using Insight Toolkit\r\nITK . The algorithms chosen for implementation are are 1) Geodesic Active contour Levelset segmentation and 2) Shape Detection Levelset segmentation. The project is oriented to expose the concepts of Open Data, Open Source and Open Access which form the pillars of open-source software ideology.",
