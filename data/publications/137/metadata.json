    "abstract": "This paper describes a new tutorial book titled \"An Introduction to Programming for Medical Image Analysis with the Visualization Toolkit.\" This book derived from a set of class handouts used in a biomedical engineering graduate seminar at Yale University. The goal for the seminar was to\r\nintroduce the students to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and, to a lesser extent, the Insight Toolkit (ITK). A draft version of the complete book (including all the sample code) is available online at www.bioimagesuite.org/vtkbook.",
