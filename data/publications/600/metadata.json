    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an automatic method for extracting center axis representations (centerlines) \r\nof coronary arteries in contrast enhanced (CE)-CT angiography scans. \r\nThe algorithm first detects the aorta which is used as an initial mask for ostia\r\ndetection~cite{grady2006:fast}. Second, the ostia locations are detected via a vessel centerline extraction method~cite{Gulsun:Tek:008} which\r\ntracks the center axis of the coronaries starting from the aorta surface. The full centerline tree of the coronary arteries are\r\ncomputed via the multi-scale medialness-based vessel tree extraction algorithm which starts a tracking process from\r\nthe ostia locations until all the braches are reached. The centerline extraction algorithm is a \r\ngraph-based optimization algorithm using multi-scale medialness filters.",
