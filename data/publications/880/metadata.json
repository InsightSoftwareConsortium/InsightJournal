    "abstract": "In the medical simulation world the use of isosurfaces is a common action, as the information from some sources, e.g. CTs, is very well defined, and the isosurface can be easily set. Additionally, in any simulator shadows are a necessary addition to increase the users immersion as well as its depth perception. Unfortunately, the Visualization Toolkit does not offer these features, and so in this paper a modified vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMapper is presented. This modified version allows volumetric isosurface rendering as well as receiving shadows from polygons using the usual pipeline. ",

However, it seems that it gives an error in your case. The piece of code is:\r\n\r\nIF(CMAKE_HOST_WIN32)\r\n SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \\\"${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} /arch:SSE2 /MP\\\"\r\n)\r\nENDIF(CMAKE_HOST_WIN32)\r\n\r\nStarts in line 82. If you comment or erase said piece of code it should not give you that error. We will see how it can be changed so that those options can be used when available, thanks for telling!\r\n\r\nI hope this solves your problem!",

However, it does not seem that the changes you say are the cause for such an error. It seems as if the vtkGPUVolumeRayCastMapper2 was not included, I guess you are using the the cmake in the main folder to create the project right? \r\n\r\nAdditionally, just to make sure, this lib needs VTK 5.8 or higher, as it uses a class that is not present in earlier versions (which is the reason why the automatic testing could not be done).\r\n\r\nDo any of these comments help?\r\n",
