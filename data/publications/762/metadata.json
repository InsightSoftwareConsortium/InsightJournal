    "abstract": "This documents is about the filter itkQuadEdgeMeshSimilarityCalculator. It takes inputs of two meshes and gives the similarity of the labels on them in two types of similarity measurements \u2013 Dice Similarity and Jaccard Similarity.\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.",
