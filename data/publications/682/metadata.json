    "abstract": "The existing CMake and CTest environment provides an excellent platform for execution and submission of software quality tests. However, there is little support or aid for regression type tests provided to lessen the burden of writing tests and verifying the results. We propose an additional facility to compare measurements generated by a software quality test to a based-line result. Our approach enables the ability to use multiple images as measurements, along with integer, floating point and string values for regression tests. We describe a new testing class framework which provides the functionality of reading, writing, comparing and differentiating named measurements.",
