    "abstract": "This document presents an implementation of a stratified mesh sampling algorithm in the VTK framework. This code was adapted directly from the original implementation by Diego Nehab, with permission. We present a class, vtkStratifiedSampling, which uniformly samples a mesh. A Paraview plugin interface is provided to allow extremely easy experimentation with the new functionality. We propose these classes as an addition to the Visualization Toolkit.",
