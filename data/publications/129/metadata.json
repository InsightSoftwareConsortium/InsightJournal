    "abstract": "The current ITK release (2.8) already contains a filter that enables permuting coordinate axes of an image: PermuteAxesImageFilter. PermuteAxesTransform provides similar functionality in form if ITK transform. It enables permuting axes as a part of image resampling or it may be combined with other transforms. Such techniques save system resources as they does not require an extra filter to be present in a pipeline.",
