    "abstract": "This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to perform landmark-based registration on two meshes. The method implemented here is restricted to meshes with a spherical geometry and topology. Please refer Wahba's paper for the mathematical details and Zou's paper for the applications.\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.",
