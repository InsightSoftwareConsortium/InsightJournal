    "abstract": "An Insight Toolkit (ITK) processing framework for segmentation using active contours without edges \r\nis presented in this paper. Our algorithm is based on the work of Chan and Vese [1] that uses level- \r\nsets to accomplish region segmentation in images with poor or no gradient information. The basic idea \r\nis to partion the image into two piecewise constant intensity regions. This work is in contrast to the \r\nlevel-set methods currently available in ITK which necessarily require gradient information. Similar to \r\nthose methods, the methods presented in this paper are also made ef\ufb01cient using a sparse implementation \r\nstrategy that solves the contour evolution PDE at the level-set boundary. The framework consists of 6 \r\nnew ITK \ufb01lters that inherit in succession from itk::SegmentationFilter. We include 2D/3D example \r\ncode, parameter settings and show the results generated on a 2D cardiac image.",
