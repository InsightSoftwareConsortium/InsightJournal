    "abstract": "RANdom SAmple Concensus (RANSAC) is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a model. It assumes that their are inliers in the data which are well explained by the chosen model. We propose a new class for VTK, vtkRANSACPlane, which estimates the best plane in a point set using the RANSAC method.",
