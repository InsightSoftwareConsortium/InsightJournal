    "abstract": "Region growing is a technique that can be used to propagate information over a mesh. We provide an iterator that can be used with vtkPointSet subclasses to traverse a mesh in a reasonable fashion. A \"front\" is emanated from a selected starting vertex, and the iterator provides the ID of the next vertex on this front.",
