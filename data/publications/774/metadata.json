    "abstract": "This document describes the implementation of a class for the Insight Toolkit (ITK) that takes an image\nwith multi-component pixels and outputs a scalar image for each component. This can be useful when\nexamining images of vectors, tensors, etc. This \ufb01lter may be easier to use and require fewer pixel visitations than an itk::ImageAdaptor with a similar purpose, but it requires additional memory allocation.\n",
