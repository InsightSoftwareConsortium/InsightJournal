    "abstract": "This is a companion paper describing the process and parameters for tagged volume rendering of the heart. We firstly review the relevant concepts and consider the problem of visualising the coronary arteries from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. We then discuss the implementation using the SharpImage prototyping environment. Finally, we list the set of commands capable of reproducing our results using the accompanying dataset.",

Do they describe their experience with it, advantages and disadvantages? Do they provide advice for future users of those Open Source packages?]<br /><br /><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />From my perspective, the primary contribution is&nbsp;the form and detail of the paper -- it is a nice template for others who would like to write a case study.&nbsp; Having access to the code is also valuable.<br /><br /><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />Unevaluated</p><p><br /><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />At this point, I think it is probably applicable, but that has not yet been shown.&nbsp; The specific algorithms are tuned for the application.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br />More rendering examples and analysis will be beneficial.&nbsp; I also think that this can be used to show the value of visualization to the clinician which requires a study all by itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
