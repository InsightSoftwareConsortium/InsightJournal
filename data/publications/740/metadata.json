    "abstract": "This article describes an ITK implementation of the \"cuberille\" method for poloygonization of implicit surfaces. The method operates by dividing the surface into a number of small cubes called cuberilles. Each cuberille is centered at a pixel lying on the iso-surface and then quadrilaterals are generated for each face. The original approach is improved by projecting the vertices of each cuberille onto the implicit surface, smoothing the typical block-like resultant mesh. Source code and examples are provided to demonstrate the method.",
