    "abstract": "Texture analysis provides quantitative information describing properties in images such as coarseness and smoothness. Two common quantification schemes are based on co-occurence matrices and run-length matrices. Although the co-occurence measures are readily available in the Insight Toolkit, no such set of classes exists for run-length measures. This submission is meant to remedy this deficiency by providing a set of classes which are modeled after the ITK co-occurence measures classes.",
