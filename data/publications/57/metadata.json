  "abstract": "Since the 1970's B-splines have evolved to become the {\\em de facto} \r\nstandard for curve and surface representation due to many\r\nof their salient properties. Conventional least-squares \r\nscattered data fitting techniques for B-splines require the inversion \r\nof potentially large matrices. This is time-consuming as well \r\nas susceptible to ill-conditioning which leads to undesired\r\nresults. Lee {\\em et al.} proposed a novel B-spline \r\nalgorithm for fitting a 2-D cubic B-spline surface to scattered \r\ndata in \\cite{Lee}. The proposed algorithm utilizes an \r\noptional multilevel approach for better fitting results. \r\nWe generalize this technique to support $N$-dimensional \r\ndata fitting as well as arbitrary degree of B-spline. In addition, \r\nwe generalize the B-spline kernel function class to accommodate \r\nthis new image filter.",

The closed-contour use case is not as well documented (from a quick read through) as the open-contour case.",
