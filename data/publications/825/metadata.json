    "abstract": "This document describes an affine transformation algorithm as an additional feature for landmark based registration in ITK www.itk.org. The algorithm is based on the paper by Spath, H [1]. The author derives a set of linear equations from paired landmarks and generates an affine transform from them. The method implemented here gives more freedom in the choice of registration and/or initialization method in ITK. The submission describes ITK implementation of the algorithm.",
