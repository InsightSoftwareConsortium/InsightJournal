That kind of database becomes more and more interesting as the number of comparable results grows. </p><p> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />Did you try anything else than linear interpolation to extend your neighborhood in time?<br />In your illustration of the results, the shapes seems pretty smooth. Smoothing the surfaces is known to have side effect (shrinking, modifying the spatial position of some points resulting in anatomical inconcsistency when several disconnected shapes are represented). Did you have such problem? If yes, how did you deal with them?</p><p> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />This is off topic here but I feel like the algorithm paper lacks of illustrations.<br />Having data/src code/additional papers in a different location make the review difficult. I would suggest that the authors upload more material on IJ, or make a big tarball accessible from their webpage, instead of 4 to 5 different files. </p>",

        "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />This paper presents an open-science segmentation evaluation database accompanied by evaluation criteria and two manual and an automatic reference segmentations for comparison. The segmentation is dedicated to cardiac MR images showing the left ventricle in 4D (3D+time). <br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br />NA<br /> <br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br />NA<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />The paper is an excellent example for the power of open-science. Unfortunately the link to download all contributed material does not work at the time of this writing, so this review will solely be based on looking at the paper (which I took from the MIDAS &amp; Kitware collection using the papers DSpace handle) and on the presented material on the accompanying webpage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I did not reproduce the mentioned experiments or download any code.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />NA<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />As already mentioned I was not able to use any provided code.<br /> <br /> <strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />NA<br /> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />The basic idea of providing evaluation databases and criteria along with some results from other methods for comparison is in the review authors opinion (and I dare to say also in the opinion of many more people in the medical imaging community) an extremely important one. Successes from other disciplines like computer vision (stereo reconstruction, multi-view 3D reconstruction -&gt; Middlebury) or pattern recognition (face recognition databases) prove this importance despite the additional legal, ethical and of course commercial problems such an effort has in the medical community. <br /> <br /> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /> The only suggestion I currently can think of is to contribute this web-site to the list of open-science databases proposed in the workshop paper of Holms et al (Data, data everywhere). </p><p><br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p><p>Overall this paper is an important open-science contribution and IMHO should definitely be accepted for the workshop to further discuss its ideas. It is very well and clearly written, shows a good over-view of the related work, although there are some segmentation evaluation efforts like e.g. the VALMET project (Gerig et al @ MICCAI 2001) or Fenster and Chu (Evaluation of Segmentation Algorithms for Medical Imaging, IEEE-EMBS 2005) which could also be mentioned. One can of course think about the advantages and drawbacks of a watershed type segmentation to get the automatic results, but this is not the main point of this contribution. Overall very promising and I am looking forward to discussions at the workshop. </p>",
