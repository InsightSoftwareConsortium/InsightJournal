  "abstract": "This document describes a new simple gradient descent optimizer which is a potential\nreplacement or supplement for RegularStepGradientDescentOptimizer. The optimizer requires only the gradient of the parameters and uses a simple linear model internally. However, it follows the theoretical basis of a trust-region algorithm and is able to achieve greater efficiency on certain image registration cases.\n",
