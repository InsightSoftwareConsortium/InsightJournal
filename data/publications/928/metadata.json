    "abstract": "We present a novel method for segmentation and tracking of the left ventricle (LV) in 4D ultrasound sequences using a combination of automatic segmentation at the end-diastolic frame and tracking using both a global optical flow-based tracker and local block matching. The core novelty of the proposed algorithm relies on the recursive formulation of the block-matching problem, which introduces temporal consistency on the patterns being tracked. The proposed method offers a competitive solution, with average segmentation errors of 2.29 and 2.26mm in the training (#=15) and testing (#=15) datasets respectively.",
