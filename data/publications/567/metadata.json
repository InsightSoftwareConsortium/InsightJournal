    "abstract": "Very little is known about the deformation effects of tumour growth within the brain. Computer simulations have the potential to\r\ncalculate such deformations. A method for computing localised high deformations within the brain's soft tissue is presented. Such\r\nknowledge would be significant towards neuroscience and neurosurgery, particularly for quantifying tumour aggressiveness,\r\ntherapy planning, as well as surgical planning and simulation. A Finite Element mesh used in the vicinity of a growing tumour is\r\nvery quickly destroyed and cannot be used reliably unless complicated automatic re-meshing exists. Mesh-free methods are\r\ncapable of handling much larger deformations, however are known to be less reliable that Finite Element analysis for moderate\r\ndeformations. A mixed-mesh approach utilises mesh-free regions within localised high-deformation zones, with the remaining\r\nmodel comprised of a Finite Element mesh. In this study, a new algorithm is proposed coupling the Finite Element and Element\r\nFree Galerkin methods for use in applications of high localised deformation, such as brain tumour growth. The algorithm is\r\nverified against a number of separate Finite Element and mesh-free problems solved via validated/commercial software.\r\nMaximum errors of less than 0.85 mm were maintained, corresponding to the working resolution of an MRI scan. A mixed-mesh\r\nbrain model is analysed with respect to different tumour growth volumes located behind the left ventricle. Significant\r\ndisplacements of up to 9.66 mm surrounding a 4118 mm3 sized tumour are noted, with 14.5% of the brain mesh suffering\r\ndeformation greater than 5 mm.",

In this<br />paper, authors adopted this method into new biological application, brain tumor, and shown with nice<br />numerical validation. I can follow mathematical parts of EFG, but authors may need to add more details<br />into section 3.2, Analysis Solver. Because the format of Total Largrange equation is not easy to be<br />understood.<br />Since meshfree method is the key selling point of this paper, authors should discuss more details of EFG<br />implementation. EFG has been proved with enough stability and consisitency in mechanical application in<br />many papers. Penalty method has been proposed to handle essenstial conditions very well. But authors<br />claim that a solely mesh-free Element Free Galerkin (EFG) model will prove to be inefficient, suffering<br />from consistency and stability issues, as well as Dirichlet boundary difficulties (page 1). If it is in this<br />particular application, brain tumor, authors should use numerical experiments to support their claims. If it<br />has been proved in other papers, authors should add more details and put enough references over there.<br />Authors also claims that FEM on its own will be inaccurate and problematic for modelling the brain<br />deformation response to tumour growth, since the mesh surrounding the tumour is easily distorted,<br />consequently destroying elements. Yes, it is true. but authors should also metion that remesh in this<br />situatuon is very time-consuming even though FEM can handle large deformation after remehsing.<br />Section 3.1.2 Mixed-Mesh Reader, and Figure 3.1: Block diagram of the preprocessing phase (red) and<br />analysis solver (green) may not be able to help understand FEM and EFG so much. It is a little bit far away<br />from coupling of FEM and EFG. The details of implementation, such as how to do integeration for EFG,<br />how to chose the density of nodes in EFG and how to handle the interface of FEM and EFG may help a lot.<br />",
