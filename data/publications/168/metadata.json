    "abstract": "This paper describes the ITK implementation of a transform initializer to produce a rigid 3-D transform able to center a given point on an arbitrary plane. The resultant transform allows the user to \"look at\" a point from a given direction. The resultant transform can also be used to obtain an oblique section: a single arbitrary 2-D slice through a 3-D image.",

        "content": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />The paper describes a method to specify a transform given the center point of a section, the section normal and the output size. Then it incorporates this transformation into a filter in order to obtain a 2D section image from a 3D image.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong><br /> Not applicable.<br /> <br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br />The author demonstrates the efficiency of the method by providing some examples and tests with synthetic and real data.<br /> <br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br /> </p><p>The work adheres to the concept of Open Science. Source code, test images and images shown in the paper are provided. </p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br /> </p><p>I managed to compile the source code and run the tests. Results were reproduced without problem as some tests with parameters were available. <br /> <br /> <strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong></p><p>The implementation uses and extends ITK. </p><p><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong></p><p>Source code is provided and its usage is straightforward.</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br /> </p><p>In my opinion it is better to create a LookUpTransform that inherits from Rigid3DTransform instead of using initializer. I did this and incorporated some other changes (see attachment). These include:</p><p>- LookAtTransformInitializer changed to LookAtTransform that inherits Rigid3DTransform.</p><p>- m_Image is no longer a member as it is unnecessary just to specify output spacing. This spacing is incorporated as argument to the call SetPlane().</p><p>- The output spacing does not need to be the same as the input image spacing. Changed this (see previous).</p><p>- The template parameter for the transform is the 2D image, not the 3D image. This makes more sense in my opinion.</p><p> With respects to the tests, there is no usage information for command line as in ITK examples.</p><p> <br /> <strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong></p><p>The method can be applied to any problem that requires the extraction of a section given its center and normal. </p><p> <strong>Suggestions for future work:</strong><br /> </p><p>None. </p><p><strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong></p><p>None. </p><p> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p><p>There is an error in the figure description. It says first and second row where it should say first and second column. </p>",
