  "abstract": "This paper describes an integrated system for dental implantation including both preoperative planning utilizing computer-aided technology and automatic robot operation during the intra-operative stage. A novel two-step registration procedure was applied for transforming the preoperative plan to the operation of the robot, with the help of a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM). Experiments with a patient-specific phantom were carried out to evaluate the registration error for both position and orientation. After adopting several improvements, registration accuracy of the system was significantly improved. Sub-millimeter accuracy with the Target Registration Errors (TREs) of 0.38\u00b10.16 mm (N=5) was achieved. The target orientation errors after registration and after phantom drilling were 0.92\u00b10.16 \u00b0 (N=5) and 1.99\u00b11.27 \u00b0 (N=14), respectively. These results permit the ultimate goal of an automated robotic system for dental implantation.",
