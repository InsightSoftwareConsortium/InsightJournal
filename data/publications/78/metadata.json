        "content": "<b>Summary:</b>\r\nThis paper proposes an improvement to the GaussianDerivativeImageFunction while respecting backward compatibility.\r\n \r\n<b>Reproducibility:</b>\r\nI was able to compile the code <b>but only after modifing the main CMakeLists.txt</b>.\r\nNote that since the source code is templated there is no need to create a library for it. CMake was confused about this.\r\nThe following lines:\r\n\r\n #Add Source\r\n #SUBDIRS(Source)\r\n\r\nshould be removed from the main CMakeLists.txt\r\nThis is why the code is not showing up on the Insight Journal website.\r\n\r\n<b>Code Quality:</b>\r\nThe code looks good and respects ITK style for the most part.\r\n\r\n<b>Requests for additional information from authors:</b>\r\na) I could not find the RecomputeContinuousGaussianKernel() function in the current ITK cvs class.\r\nb) The plan is to test that the current ITK cvs is broken.\r\nThe best way is to add the current test Insight/Testing/Code/Common/itkGaussianDerivativeImageFunctionTest.cxx in your publication\r\nand add a test for spaced images at the end of this test. It would be great if you can submit a new revision with this modification.\r\nc) Why is this code not working in 3D?\r\n\r\n<b>Other comments</b>\r\nThis is a very good work. Thanks for the contribution!\r\n",
