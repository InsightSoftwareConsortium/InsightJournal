    "abstract": "This paper describes the Insight Toolkit (ITK) Spherical Wavelet object: itkSWaveletSource. This\r\nITK object is an implementation of a paper by Schr\u00a8oder and W. Sweldens, \u201cSpherical Wavelets: Effi-\r\nciently Representing Functions on the Sphere\u201d [8], with pseudo-code given in their paper entitled \u201cSpherical\r\nwavelets: Texture processing\u201d [7]. In these papers, Swelden et. al. show how to do decompose a\r\nscalar signal defined on a spherical mesh into spherical wavelet coefficients (analysis step, also called\r\nforward transform), and vice-versa (synthesis step, also called inverse transform). We have implemented\r\nthe spherical wavelet transform in ITK entitled itkSWaveletSource object, which will take the scalar\r\nfunction defined on a spherical mesh as input and apply spherical wavelet analysis and synthesis on it.\r\nIn this paper, we describe our code and provide the user with enough details to reproduce the results\r\nwhich we present in this paper. This filter has a variety of applications including shape representation\r\nand shape analysis of brain surfaces, which was the initial motivation for this work.\r\nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that the\r\nauthors used for validating the spherical wavelet transform described in this paper.",

        "content": "<strong>Summary:</strong><br /><p>This paper is an implementation of the original spherical wavelet paper by Swelden. The main goal is to be able to do analysis of (genus 0 = parameterizable on the sphere) shapes. It is becoming a standard approach when coupled with the spherical parameterization for brain surface analysis for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hypothesis:<br /></strong><br /><br /><br /> <strong>Evidence:</strong><br /><br /> <strong>Open Science:</strong><br />The paper is clear and explain with sufficient detail the implementation. The implementation seems to be as close as possible to the paper.</p><p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong><br />I downloaded the code, and comfigure it with for the following configuration:<br />cmake 2.4.6, Win32 on top of win64 (XP) MSVC++ 2005 (32bits).</p><p>I needed to apply the following minor changes for the code to compile:<br />itkSWaveletSource.txx:308,309<br />&lt; unsigned long nOfVerts = 10*pow(4,i) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />&lt; unsigned long nOfNewVerts = 10*pow(4,i+1) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />---<br />&gt; unsigned long nOfVerts = 10*pow(4.0,(int)i) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />&gt; unsigned long nOfNewVerts = 10*pow(4.0,(int)i+1) + 2; // for icosahedron.<br />itkSWaveletSource.txx:841<br />&lt; int resolution = 1 + floor(log((nOriVerts-2)/10)/log(4));<br />---<br />&gt; int resolution = 1 + floor(log((nOriVerts-2.0)/10.0)/log(4.0));</p><p>Thedefault example did not work. It seems to exhaust the memory trying to read a file:<br />itkSWaveletTest5.cxx:60 getScalarFn(&quot;x10.txt&quot;, oriF);<br />itkSWaveletTest5.cxx:99 scalarFn.push_back(a);<br />[...]<br />Unhandled exception at 0x7d4e2366 in itkSWaveletTest5.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: std::bad_alloc at memory location 0x0139fb6c..</p><p>It came from my building in a separate tree. The example assumes that you are running it at the sme level as the files. Moreover, the getScalarFn that reads from disk does not check if the file was found and is open before it tries to read from it.<br />Here are the corresponding fixes:<br /> :60,61:<br />getScalarFn(&quot;../x10.txt&quot;, oriF);<br />mySphereMeshSource-&gt;SetScalarFunctionWithSphere( &quot;../para10.meta&quot;, oriF);</p><p>:92,105:<br />void getScalarFn(char* scalarFileName, std::vector&lt; double &gt;&amp; scalarFn)<br />{<br />&nbsp; std::ifstream f(scalarFileName);<br />&nbsp; if( f.fail( ) )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // print an error here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit( EXIT_FAILURE );<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; double a;<br />&nbsp; while(!f.eof())<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f&gt;&gt;a;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scalarFn.push_back(a);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p><p><strong>Use of Open Source Software:</strong><br />The filter is written on top of ITK.</p><p> <strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong><br />The paper is clear and explain with sufficient detail the implementation.</p><p><strong>Code Quality:</strong><br />As for the design, I love the work on the wavelet coefficients. Being able to access both the mesh and the corresponding wavelet at any level of decomposition is a great idea. It open the way to a lot of applications (compression, watermarking, any filtering, ...).</p><p>The code is not yet up to ITK standard: there seems to be a lot of commented out code. the debug and warning macro are not used (cerr is used instead) and it seems to have be written using arrays first. Some parts have been rewritten using stl (vector) but some parts still used arrays. Testing it through the web interface of KWStyle could help the authors enhance the style greatly (http://66.194.253.24/KWStyle/).</p><p>The types are hard coded, and ,as the author themselves admit, templating it depending on the mesh traits or on other arithmetic types would be great.</p><p>The code is written on top of itk::Mesh and thus must deal with a lot of shortcomings. The authors reimplement a pointToCell array and assume orientability, orientation consistency as well as 2-manifoldness. I&#39;m pretty sure the code would break if you use as input a sphere of which one triangle or more would be flipped inside-out. It would also be nice to check if the mesh is triangular first. I would recommand, if the author had the time, to rewrite it on top of an itkQuadEdgeMesh. One itkMeshToMeshFilter enforcing the orientation would still be need though. </p><p>It would be nice to have the subdivision part separated from the wavelet feature. We could think of a general 1 to 4 subdivision filter (abstract, topology only) with a set of functions implementing the geometrical behavior (new point function of old point + mask). That open the way to subdivision filters in ITK, as well as predictive filtering for wavelet compression, lazy wavelets and so on. </p><p><strong>Applicability to other problems:</strong><br />There is the direct problem the authors are addressing: (brain surface) shape analysis, but having access to the wavelet and to the inverse transform, you can think about almost any kind of filtering in wavelet space including:<br />- denoising (wavelet coefficient thresholding)<br />- compression,<br />- watermarking,<br />- optimization of active surface algorithms,<br />You can see those two pages for ideas:<br />http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~agouaillard/Research.htm<br />http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~valette/publis.htm </p><p><strong>Suggestions for future work:<br /></strong>- write a test suite to enforce the expected behavior, it would help reviewers make some experiments with the code and even add fonctionalities.<br />- template over meshtraits / arithmetic types.<br /> - rewrite on top of of QEMesh (much easier to code, much easier to maintain, faster)<br />- separate subdivision from wavelet<br />- would pluggable wavelet functions be too hard to code (I sincerely have no idea) ?<br /><br /> <strong>Requests for additional information from authors:</strong><br />I loved the paper.</p><p> <strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />i&#39;d like to help the authors fix the problems, and even implement some of my recommendations.</p>",
