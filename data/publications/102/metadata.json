    "abstract": "The gestational age (GA) determination is one of the most used measures to guide diagnostics of specialists in neonatology to\r\nguarantee the newborn surveillance. However, the currently available methods have been subject to a number of evaluations and criticism by important medical publications concerning both their low precision and their invasive procedures. Based on this scenario, the FootScanAge method was conceived, seeking to determine the GA through digital imaging of the newborn plantar surface. To support the evaluation and evolution of this new method, it was developed an Open Source and Java based Decision Support System that combines Data Mining and Image Processing techniques to implement the FootScanAge method. The system was developed taking advantage of high degree of interaction between experts in neonatology and computer science.",
