    "abstract": "This document describes a set of classes that designs a generic explicit deformable model in VTK. The iterative mechanism is first introduced through an inheritance of the vtkPolyDataAlgorithm class. This vtkIterativePolyDataAlgorithm is then a base for an implementation of the deformation. Two examples of deformation are presented through an inheritance of this base class. The provided source code may be used to build a ParaView plugin that harnesses the animation feature.\n",
