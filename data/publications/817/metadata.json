    "abstract": "A software architecture has been developed for image-guided robot-assisted cell manipulation. The system provides tools for positioning and navigation of multiple micromanipulators under live microscope images. The main application of this system is in multi-electrode patch clamp electrophysiology; however the same architecture can be used for any other type of cell micromanipulation as well as other applications such as micro-assembly.",
