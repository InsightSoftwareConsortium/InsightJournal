    "abstract": "This documents describes the filter itk::HistogramMatchingQuadEdgeMeshFilter. It takes an input (source) mesh and a reference mesh, normalizes the scalar values between two meshes by histogram matching, and generates an output mesh which has a similar histogram as the input mesh. \nThis paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.",
