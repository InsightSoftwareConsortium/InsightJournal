    "abstract": "The \\emph{Delaunay triangulation} is the triangulation of a set of points which maximizes the minimum angle of all angles of the triangles, and thus triangle aspect ratios. So converting a non Delaunay triangulation into a Delaunay triangulation, \\emph{Delaunay conforming}, improves the all triangle aspect ratios and avoid elongated triangles. Note that combining this filter with usual operations like smoothing will provide a better approximation and a better distribution a triangle aspect ratios. Here this document describes a new filter based on the $n$D $2$-manifold mesh data structure available in itk: \\code{itk::QuadEdgeMesh}~\\cite{itkQE} to produce (planar or surfacic) Delaunay triangulation from any non-Delaunay triangulation by edge flipping, by implementing the edge flipping method decribed in~\\cite{Dyer2007sgp}.",
