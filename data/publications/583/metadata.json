    "abstract": "This document describes a user-steered method to interactively track centerlines of tubular objects in 3D space. The method is developed as a plug-in of ImageJ using Java language. To evaluate the tracking ability and tracking accuracy, this method has been applied to coronary artery tracking in coronary CT angiography data. Its potential as a user-steered 3D centerline tracking tool has been discussed as well as its limitations and possible improvements.",
