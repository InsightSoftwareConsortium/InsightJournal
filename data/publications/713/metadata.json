    "abstract": "This document presents a set of classes (vtkPointSetSurfaceReconstruction, vtkVoxelizePolyData) to produce a surface from an oriented point set. These classes are implemented as VTK filters. A Paraview plugin interface is provided to allow extremely easy experimentation with the new functionality. We propose these classes as an addition to the Visualization Toolkit. The code is available here: https://github.com/daviddoria/PointSetSurfaceReconstruction",
