    "abstract": "The Surgical Assistant Workstation (SAW) is a software development framework that can be used to\r\ndevelop new applications in robot-assisted surgery with augmented visualization. Robot-assisted laparoscopic\r\nsurgery and micro-surgery as presented by the da Vinci telerobotic system and the Johns\r\nHopkins Steady Hand, respectively can be improved by providing fully-integrated image guidance and\r\ninformation-enhanced intra-operative assistance to the surgical team and to the surgeon in particular.\r\nThis paper describes several use case applications of the SAW framework, as well as a novel user interface\r\nlibrary being developed to support 3D interactive menu systems and overlays for surgical guidance.",
