    "abstract": "\nThis document presents an implementation of an algorithm to find a low edge-count approximation of a complex, discrete, 2D closed contour. This implementation is based on the algorithm described in ``Using Aerial Lidar Data to Segment And Model Buildings'' and ``A Bayesian Approach to Building Footprint Extraction from Aerial LIDAR Data.''\n\nThe code is available here:\nhttps://github.com/daviddoria/ClosedLoopSimplification",
