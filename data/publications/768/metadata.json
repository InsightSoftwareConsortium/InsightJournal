    "abstract": "Being able to quickly compute the inverse of a deformation \ufb01eld is often useful in the context of medical image analysis. While ITK supports this functionality, the current algorithms are slow and do not always yield accurate results. In this paper we describe an ITK implementation of a \ufb01xed point algorithm for the approximate inversion of deformation \ufb01elds that was recently proposed by M. Chen and co-workers. The algorithm has been shown to be both faster and more accurate than those currently implemented in ITK.\n",

        "content": "Hi,\r\n\r\nthanks for the filter, works very good and is fast.\r\n\r\nI had one problem, which appears when the inverse is not expected to be in the same physical domain as the deformation itself. It can be resolved by overwriting the following function\r\n\r\n template <class TInputImage, class TOutputImage>\r\n    void\r\n    FixedPointInverseDeformationFieldImageFilter<TInputImage,TOutputImage>\r\n    ::GenerateInputRequestedRegion(){\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhich is used to set the requested region of the input to the requested region of the output in the regular filter pipeline. In this filter, this is not necessary.\r\n\r\n",
