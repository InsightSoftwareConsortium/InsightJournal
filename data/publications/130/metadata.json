    "abstract": "Polar transform is a geometric transform, that transforms points form cartesian coordinates to so-called polar coordinates. In case of 2D space, a point in polar coordinate system is addressed by radius and angle. In image processing, polar transform is usually used to convert rotations around the origin of polar coordinate system to translations. \r\n\r\nThis submission contains the implementation of forward and inverse polar transforms in two very simple classes for the Insight Toolkit.",

I don\\'t know if it was intentionally so; but it looks like an error, because the conversion from polar to cartesian considers the input to be (radius, theta).",
